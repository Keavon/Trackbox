			<h1>Describe your music with tags.</h1>
			<p>The best way to sort your music is to describe it. First add tags to your albums, artists, and tracks. Then simply click on a tag to view all corresponding songs.</p>

<section id="boxes" class="gray">
	<div>
		<div>
			<h1>Sort your music in boxes.</h1>
			<p>Traditional playlists are static and designed for individual songs, not music collections. We set out to fix that with boxes. Just drag and drop tracks and any combination of albums, artists, and tags into one of your boxes to create a collection of songs fitting those terms. As your library grows, matching songs are added to your boxes automatically.</p>
