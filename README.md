# Trackbox, the Simple and Beautiful Music Player
## Experience your music collection, built around you

### Simple, beautiful interface for your whole music library
A clean, focused, & productive interface designed from the ground up to help you organize and play your songs with ease. No clutter or gimmicky features; just you and your music.

### Tags & Pages: Sort and play your music with ease
Traditional playlists are inefficient and built for individual songs, not music collections. We set out to fix that with pages. In Trackbox, add any combination of artists, albums, search terms, ratings, tags, and more to a page and the songs carry along with it. As your library grows, matching songs are added to your pages automatically.

To compliment pages, we also created tags. Add as many tags as you want to tracks or albums and use them for sorting mixes and pages. Slap the tag “No Lyrics” and “Electronic” on a fitting song or album. Next time you want some music without lyrics to help you focus, drag the “No Lyrics” tag into a new mix. Want a page with all your favorite electronic music? Drag the “Electronic” tag into a new page then rock out.

### Smarter playback for a smarter world
Build a mix in a matter of seconds then enjoy hours of your favorite music selected specially for you, weighted for your playback terms and your favorite songs. It even avoids frequent repeats to keep things fresh. Love your mix? Save it for later or pin it as a page.

### 100% open to customization, plug-ins, and skins
Trackbox is built with Web technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—so anyone can easily make a plug-in or skin to customize any part of the experience.

Free, open source, and cross-platform
