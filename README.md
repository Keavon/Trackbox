#Trackbox

Trackbox is a free, open source desktop music library player licensed under the GPL v3 license. It is being developed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript wrapped in a desktop application using the Chromium Embedded Framework. The wrapper is currently exclusive to Windows, but there will be a Linux and OS X wrapper in the future to fulfil the cross-platform vision and freedom that drives Trackbox.

The goal of Trackbox is to design a great looking minimalistic interface that's easy to use and houses innovative features not seen in other music library players. It is built from our frustration with other music players lacking freedom for customization, usable interfaces, support for advanced file types, cross-platform availability, and intelligent features. Wanting to merge these requirements into one great application, we created Trackbox.

Some of the intelligent features include:
* FLAC support
* Music tags
* Customized playback
* Advanced shuffle
* The "pages" system
* Intelligent playback queue

All music can be given unlimited tags, for example "rock" and "lyrics". The user can then customize their playback to skip all songs with the tag "lyrics" or only play songs with the tag "rock" and "upbeat". This customized playback will create a temporary page which the user can choose to save. The full library is the "master" page, and all other pages can be saved or discarded when they are no longer needed. Users can create playlists which take the form of a saved page. To create a queue, just click the small dot at the left of each song to add it to the queue. The queue will play in its order but it will also create a temporary page that the user can saveâ€” an easy way to make a playlist. These features are a few of the biggest plans for a unique, powerful, and easy to use music library player with a simple and non-cluttered interface... all completely free, open source, and extensible.
